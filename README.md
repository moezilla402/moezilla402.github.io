## Welcome to My GitHub Page

I started this page as a part of the GitHub tutorial, and also as a part of a college course I took sometime in 2019 or 2020. Honestly, I usually only do coding projects while in school, even though I tend to enjoy the process. There are times when I _think_ I should put more effort into learning to write better code.

In the past, I learned _just enough_ of assembly language and C/C++ to pass specific college courses. Later, I had to figure out Python in graduate school.  I have even worked on Java and HTML a bit as side projects and curiosities. 

In the end, I enjoy the art of solving the "engineering problem" but do not enjoy the linguistical aspects of _really_ learning programming languages as much. 

This may (or may not) work from time to time:
